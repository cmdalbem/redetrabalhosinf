script/refactor
===============
This plugin provides a simple script. It helps you refactor rails applications.
Say, you have 'user' resource, and you want to change the name of the resource to 'person',
the script replaces name of files, directories, constants, variables and so forth.

== INSTALL
First of all, if you don't install this via:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/hiroshi/script-refactor.git

You may have no script/refactor. If so, do install.rb by hand:

  ruby vendor/plugins/script-refactor/install.rb

Next, just type:

  script/refactor

You will see the usage and other information of the script.
